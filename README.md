# tkinter_applications_api
Below are some examples of how to use tkinter in making applications. It contains one basic calculator , one password generator and one weather application which  uses api and teels you live weather information based on city.

#### 'Calculator application is named as Calculator.ipynb'
#### 'Password Generator is named as password_generator.ipynb'
#### 'Weather application is named as weather_app.ipynb'

`Note:-` In case of using my weather application or calculator or password generator source code I have provided a .ico image for both which I used to set logo on my application please download it also and add to same directory as the source code otherwise it will show error.
